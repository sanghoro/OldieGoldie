## Abstract
The “Oldie Goldie” project is a user friendly e-commerce app built with React. It allows users to browse various products from fakestoreAPI.
The application features intuitive design, enabling users to effortlessly navigate through different categories- including all products, women's, men's jewelry and electronic sections.
Users can search for specific products, and view detailed product information. Users can also add the desired products into the shopping bag, and it displays the subtotal, tax (texas based) and total amount.
Additionally, the project includes robust error handling, in case of data fetching issues or navigation errors. 
The project showcases modern web development practices, including the use of React hooks for state management, React Router for navigation, and Cypress for end-to-end testing.
